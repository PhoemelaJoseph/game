        <h1>About Phoemela Joseph</h1>
        <p>
           Hi, My name is Phoemela Joseph. I'm not a huge fan of games but a game that I admire is Super Smash bros. I like this game because there is a goal you need to achieve, and once you complete that goal you earn new characters! you can play against your friends and even an online robot. My defintion of a game is where you have to go through a conflict and you have to solve it and there is a goal at the end which you earn and it can be used on good things.
